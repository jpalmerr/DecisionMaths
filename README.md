#Decision Maths

After first coming across the topic in sixth form, *Decision Maths & Game Theory* became by favourite area of Mathematics.
Unfortunately, there was never the option to specialise in this module during my final year of university.

However, I would like to focus on this once again. This project is an attempt to combine two passions (one being my livelihood), of decision maths and scala code. 

This project is purely recreational.
